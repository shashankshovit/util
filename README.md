# Javascript Utilities
This package includes many developer friendly utility files which would ease the development. Each utility file has a demo html file as well which would help understand, playaround in console with the demo window variable created.

## List of utilities
1. Type: A short and sweet type checker with already written methods for checking the types of js variables.
2. ArrayPlus: An enriched Array class with some developer friendly methods. This utility even lets you create circular arrays.
3. ObjectPlus: Advanced Object class which lets you clone/deep copy objects and arrays. Whoa, toString() method doesn't give you [object Object]!
4. ArrayToTree: Pass a list of elements with parent flags and this utility reformats the list in tree structure with some configuration options.

## Demo
Each class has a demo html file as well. Look for html file with 'ClassName + Demo' for reference purposes.
